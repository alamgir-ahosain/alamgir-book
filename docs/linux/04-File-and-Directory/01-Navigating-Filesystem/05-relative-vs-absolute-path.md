<h1>Paths</h1>

>A path is a list of directories separated by the **/** character.

There are two types of paths: 
 1. absolute 
2. Relative


<h3>Absolute Path</h3>

* Specify the exact location of a directory
* Always shows the **full location**
* Starts from the **root directory (`/`)**
* Example: `/home/user/Documents/file.txt`

<h3>Relative Path</h3>

* Based on the **current directory**(start from the currecnt location)
* Does **not** start with `/`
* Example: `Documents/file.txt`, `../images/pic.png`
