<h1 id="top">Spring Bean Scopes </h1>

- In Spring Framework, bean scopes define the lifecycle and visibility of beans in the Spring IoC container.
- `@Scope` defines a bean's lifecycle and visibility of the bean.

<h2>Common @Scope Values</h2>

1. **singleton( by default)**

      - Only one instance of the bean per Spring container.
      - Same object is shared everywhere.
      - This is the default scope if no other scope is specified.
      - `Lifecycle`: The bean is created when the application context is initialized and destroyed when the context is destroyed.
   <br>

2. **prototype**

      - A new instance is created every time the bean is requested.9
      - `Lifecycle`: Created every time requested, not managed by Spring after that.
   <br>

3. **request (Web-aware only)**

      - One bean instance per HTTP request.
      - Used in web applications (Spring MVC).
      - `Lifecycle`: Created for each HTTP request, destroyed at request end
   <br>

4. **session(Web-aware only)**

      - One bean instance per HTTP session.
      - `lifecycle`: Created for each HTTP session, destroyed when session ends
 <br>

5. **application (Web-aware only)**

      - One bean instance per ServletContext (entire web app).
      - Similar to singleton but specific to web context.
      - `Lifecycle`: Created when ServletContext is initialized, destroyed at shutdown.
   <br>

6. **websocket(Web-aware only, since Spring 4.2)**

      - One bean instance per WebSocket session.
      - `Lifecycle`: Created when WebSocket session is established, destroyed at session end
   

**Example**:

=== "XML"

      ```xml
      <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean" scope="prototype"/>
      ```   
  
=== "Annotation"

      ```java  
      @Component            // stereotype (registers the bean)
      @Scope("prototype")   // modifies its lifecycle(Define the scope as prototype)
      public class MyBean { 
         //Bean defination
      }
      ```



<h1>Points to remember</h1>

- @Scope is applied at the class level.
- Affects the Spring-managed bean, not the class itself.
- Each bean (even from the same class) can have a different scope.
- Does not apply globally to the class — only to the specific bean definition.

   ```java
   @Configuration
   public class AppConfig {

      @Bean
      @Scope("singleton")  // First bean with singleton scope
      public MyBean singletonBean() {
         // This scope applies only to the Spring-managed bean of singletonBean
         return new MyBean();
      }

      @Bean
      @Scope("prototype")  // Second bean with prototype scope
      public MyBean prototypeBean() {
         // This scope applies only to the Spring-managed bean of prototypeBean
         return new MyBean();
      }
   }
   ```
