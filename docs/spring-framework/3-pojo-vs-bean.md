<h1>POJO vs Bean</h1>

**POJO (Plain Old Java Object)**
- A simple Java object, not bound by any special restrictions or frameworks.
- Can have fields, getters/setters, and methods.

**Bean**
- A POJO managed by the Spring IoC container.
- Instantiated, configured, and injected by Spring.

> All Spring beans are POJOs, but not all POJOs are Spring beans.
