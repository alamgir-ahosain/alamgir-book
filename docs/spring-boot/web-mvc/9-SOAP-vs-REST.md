<h1>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)</h1>

- Protocol: A strict communication `protocol`.
- Format:` Always XML` (SOAP messages are wrapped inside an <Envelope>).
- Transport: Usually HTTP, but can also use SMTP, TCP, etc.
- Standards: Has built-in rules for security (WS-Security), transactions, error handling.
- State: Stateful or Stateless.
- Tight coupling: Requires both client and server to strictly follow WSDL (Web Services Description Language).


<h1>REST (Representational State Transfer)</h1>

- `Architecture style` (not a protocol).
- Format: Can use `JSON`, XML, HTML, or plain text (JSON is most common).
- Transport: Always uses `HTTP` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Stateless: Each request contains all necessary info (server doesnâ€™t remember client state).
- Lightweight & flexible compared to SOAP.
