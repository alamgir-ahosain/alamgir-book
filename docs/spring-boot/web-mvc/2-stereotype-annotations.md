<h1 id="top">Stereotype Annotations</h1>

- Special annotations that tell Spring which layer a class belongs to.
- When Spring starts, it scans packages (`via @ComponentScan`) and registers the class as a Spring Bean in the `ApplicationContext`.
- Can be injected with @Autowired / constructor injection.
